        <h3>Problem Framing</h3>
        <p>The current experience fitness apps provide is passive, users take most of the reponsibilities of planning, executing, and motivating themselves.</p>
        <p>To better understand the problem, we created a Lean UX Canvas.</p>
        <img src="img/lean-ux-canvas.png" alt="Lean UX Canvas" />
        <p><strong>How might we improve the fitness experience so that users are more successful in keeping a fitness lifestyle?</strong></p>

      <div class="colorBG" id="personas">
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>We developed practical personas to explore what we think we know and to start the discussion of what we don’t know. We also used practical personas to focus on representative users and to prioritizing the user’s goals over a feature.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>We were at the discovery stage of our product development. We needed learn more to validate the risks associated with our practical personas. This research is going help us find out if we are right about what we already know and discover what we don’t know.</p>
        <h3>Research Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Understand the targeted users’ recent experience on their fitness journey.</li>
          <li>Understand how targeted users approach the topic of fitness, the context, the struggles, and the delight.</li>
          <li>Validate the risks associated with personas.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Research Protocol</h3>
        <p>We developed a research protocal to help us stay focused and aligned on the goals of the resesarch.</p>
        <h3>Semi-Structured User Interview</h3>
        <p>We spent two weeks and met with 12 participants on Zoom. Each session was 30 minutes with one participation, one proctor, one notetaker, and two observers. We recorded each session after gaining consent from the participants, we also consolidated our notes at the end of each day.</p>

        <h3>Story Mapping</h3>
        <p>To create a shared understanding in our team, we made a user story map to help understand user-focused solutions, identify holes, and break down discovery, design, and development into achievable pieces. We then can prioritize them and put them into action.</p>
