        <h3>Problem Framing</h3>
        <p>The current experience fitness apps provide is passive, users take most of the reponsibilities of planning, executing, and motivating themselves.<br> To better understand the problem, we created a Lean UX Canvas.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>We were at the discovery stage of our product development. We needed learn more to validate the risks associated with our practical personas. This research is going help us find out if we are right about what we already know and discover what we don’t know.</p>
        <h3>Research Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Understand the targeted users’ recent experience on their fitness journey.</li>
          <li>Understand how targeted users approach the topic of fitness, the context, the struggles, and the delight.</li>
          <li>Validate the risks associated with personas.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Research Protocol</h3>
        <p>We developed a research protocal to help us stay focused and aligned on the goals of the resesarch.</p>
        <h3>Semi-Structured User Interview</h3>
        <p>We spent two weeks and met with 12 participants on Zoom. Each session was 30 minutes with one participation, one proctor, one notetaker, and two observers. We recorded each session after gaining consent from the participants, we also consolidated our notes at the end of each day.</p>

        <p>In general, users have a difficult time keeping a fitness routine in their busy lives and finding workouts that fit their needs. They need an easy way to plan, personalize, and prioritize fitness. We believe we are able to help all three of them.</p>
        <h3>Key Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="orange">Personalization</span> and <span class="orange">flexibility</span> are desired when engaging with fitness products.</li>
          <li>People seek <span class="orange">safe</span> and effective exercises that provide guidance and make them <span class="orange">feel good</span>.</li>
          <li>The ability to <span class="orange">plan</span> and <span class="orange">prepare</span> ahead of time holds people accountable for exercise and makes establishing a routine easier.</li>
          <li>People seek direction and motivation in <span class="orange">progress tracking</span> and <span class="orange">rewards</span>. </li>
          <li><span class="orange">Social</span> environment plays a big role in fitness and it comes in many forms, including workout buddies, group fitness, trainer feedback, and etc.</li>
          <li>People seek <span class="orange">quick</span> and <span class="orange">simple</span> exercise experience.</li>

        <h3>Story Mapping</h3>
        <p>To create a shared understanding in our team, we made a user story map to help understand user-focused solutions, identify holes, and break down discovery, design, and development into achievable pieces. We then can prioritize them and put them into action.</p>

      <h3>What I learned</h3>
      <p>I learned that a well-positioned introduction to users in a discovery research is very important. We either had to “pull” information out of the participants or they focused on discussing the current fitness apps they used because they thought that’s what we wanted to hear. So a good introduction informing the participants that want to understand their fitness lives in general is crucial on setting them up for success. </p>
      <h3>What Could've Gone Differently?</h3>
      <p>This is a 10-week design and research project utilizing Lean UX methodologies. If I had more time, I would like to design a survey for a competitive analysis prior to the discovery research to get a pulse on users’ unmet needs. We could then incoorporate it into our opportunity statement.</p>
