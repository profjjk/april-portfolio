        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Surfin is a search engin that can search on a system level on your mobile device. The feature was at the end of the development road map and the beta version was released in the U.S. and Singapore.</p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I was the researcher on this project. I collaborated with two engineers and the product manager.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>We received insufficient analytics data on Surfin from users in Singapore, the product team wanted more insights on how users use Surfin and the overall user experience in Singapore.</p>
        <h2>Problem Validation</h2>
        <div id="validation">
          <div class="validation-item">

        <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To understand how users in Singapore use Surfin and what they search for.</li>
          <li>To uncover the user pain points and unfulfilled needs of users in Singapore.</li>
          <li>To understand the overall user experience of users in Singapore.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Designed a survey for target demographic.</li>
          <li>Conducted a 30-minute semi-structured interview with each participant.</li>
          <li>Conducted a 30-minute usability testing with each participant.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Research Protocol</h2>
        <p>After clarifying our research objectives, we developed a research protocol to create a shared understanding within the team and help us stay focused on the research objectives.</p>
        <p id="research-protocol">The research protocol includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Research Objectives</li>
          <li>Recruiting Requirements</li>
          <li>Research Methods</li>
          <li>Research Questions</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="whiteBG">
        <h2>Recruiting</h2>
        <p>We developed a survey screener and recruited 20 participatns from beta users that resided in Singapore.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Semi-Structured Interview</strong></p>
        <p>We had 1:1 interviews with all of our participants to understand how they perceive to use Surfin, pain points, the overall experience with it, and their verbal response related to the observed behaviors.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Usability Testing</strong></p>
        <p>We asked the participants to complete guided tasks and unguided tasks using Surfin while observing their behaviors. We also invited the stakeholders to the sessions to build empathy.</p>

        <h2>Synthesis</h2>
        <div id="synthesis">
          <div>
            <p>We organized our notes and recordings and created an affinity map to help us find, group, and visualize themes.</p>
            <p>We took the bottom up approach (inductive) to generate themes found in the raw data. We then interpreted the findings into useful insights.</p>

        <p>For the overall usage, 65% of the users use the feature daily, which is quite good. And over 60% of users find the overall experience with the feature to be positive.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Surfin should return frequently searched items in the top results􏰀</li>
          <li>Calendar shouldn’t return past holidays.</li>
          <li>Surfin should return search results instantly for seamless experience.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The Machine Learning implemented was improved to learn and return frequently used items as top results so users don’t have to rely on the [More Results] button too much.</li>
          <li>Surfin was changed to not return past holidays. The consistent search experience was improved.</li>
          <li>It started conversations between the teams and a few strategic approaches were put on the product backlog.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>After the design and engineering changes, we should do another round of research to measure the effectiveness of the solutions.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p><span class="blue">What was the biggest challenge?</span> Time ! We had roughly two weeks to collect data from 20 participants. The time zone difference limited our time spent with users. We often stayed up until midnight to interview 2 - 3 participants in one day.</p>
        <p>I have <span class="blue">learned</span> that exercising my intuition of knowing when to probe deeper has paid off greatly in uncovering user insights. It is especially important in a generative research like this one.</p>
        <p>One <span class="blue">limitation</span> of this research is that the beta users would generally provide more positive feedback because of their enthusiasm for our product. So evaluating our findings with proper perspectives is very important.</p>
        <p>We chose to do user interview and usability testing because we wanted to observe the user behavior and understand the related response to it. These methods together provided detailed insights in three weeks. <span class="blue">Knowing what I know today</span>, if given more time, I would have been curious to conduct a diary study in addition to what we did so that we could have more insights on the usage scenarios, user attitude, and motivation.</p>
